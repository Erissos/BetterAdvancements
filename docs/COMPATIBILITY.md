The **124 groups per run / 372 total** cover all nine plugins together. They include aggregate menu/language assertions and reused domain regressions, not 372 independent gameplay scenarios or a per-project count. Only these three runtime versions were executed for these exact hashes; the target range does not imply every intermediate version was retested.

Current runtime coverage includes plugin startup/API metadata, actual independent classloader protocol-1 links, both-side provider/configuration gates, invalid reload snapshot retention, staged YAML parsing and durable UUID language synchronization. The original three plugins additionally exercise standard localized item names; the six newer plugins include their existing compact domain/inventory/database regressions. PlayerBusiness read-only membership lookup and optional AuctionHousePro/SmartNPCWorkers benefits use actual plugin services with fixture actors. See the product check labels and exact scope in [verification.json](verification.json).

Actors are offline proxies, not connected Minecraft clients. No current claim is made for rendered UI/resource packs, full linked dungeon-party fights, actual third-party territory/licensed-provider combinations, production economy/MySQL matrices, OS-level crash recovery, plain Spigot, Folia or Forge/Fabric. Suite observations are best-effort and live-only; owning plugins retain their durable financial receipts.
